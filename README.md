# Open-Loop-Stepper-Motor-Drive-System
Construct an open loop stepper motor drive system using a stepper motor, TB6600 stepper driver, linear rail system, 12v power supply, and an Arduino. Upon start-up, the stepper must conduct a “homing” procedure using limit switches. Once at a home position, the stepper must be given commands to travel to a desired position without the use of closed loop feedback methods. The system’s travel should be bounded by hardware and software limitations via switches and step limits.
